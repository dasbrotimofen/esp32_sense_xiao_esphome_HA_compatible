# Overview

This was nightmare, as I was only able to bruteforce it because I lack understanding. This is now a working firmware for the ESP32 Sense Xiao OV3660 but perhaps also OV5640 or other. 

All of the initial idea came from https://community.home-assistant.io/t/seeed-xaio-esp32s3-with-ov5640-camera-success/856181/3 User: Steve_Campell
